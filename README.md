## 🧱 Blocks

- **Layout Options**: Grid or List
- **Columns**: 1–6 (for Grid)
- **Category Filter**: Choose specific categories to display

## 📅 Calendar Page

- Assign any page as the **Calendar Page** via plugin settings.
- That page will automatically output a responsive FullCalendar calendar.
- Events are loaded using a **custom REST API endpoint** (`/wp-json/eventswp/v1/calendar-events`) for performance.
- The calendar auto-switches to list view on small screens.

---

## 🔍 Customization

- Tailwind CSS utility classes are used throughout for clean layout.
- FullCalendar CSS is loaded from CDN.
- To override styling, enqueue your own stylesheet **after** FullCalendar in `enqueue_frontend_styles`.

## 🧠 Developer Notes

- Events are registered with support for `title`, `editor`, `thumbnail`, and `custom-fields`
- Event meta is stored via `core/editor` sidebar using `wp.data`
- REST endpoint outputs structured ISO 8601 date/time objects
- Calendar view only loads events for visible date range (performance optimized)
